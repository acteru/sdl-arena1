# Arena1

A little Bomberman clone programmed in C using SDL.

We created this project on SourceForge as part of an exercicise during my studies. It was originally created with Eclipse for Windows. Now I moved this project to GitHub and ported it to a Makefile Linux application. I did this because I'd like to have everything in one place and because this project now serves as a sample SDL / Makefile / C application.

## Compiling

1. Clone repository
2. Make sure you have the following packages installed: `sdl sdl_gfx sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf`
3. In the root directory run `make`
4. Start application in the `bin`-directory
